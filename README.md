# alpha-mafia
There are some mafias which are considered followers. Our mafia does not count itself among those. Our mafia is a leader! Or perhaps our mafia consists only of the Greek letter alpha. Who knows?


Dependenices:

Our scripts are called ask and answer, and are used accordingly

    Usage:

    ./ask article.txt nquestions
        article.txt - the article to ask questions about
        nquestions  - the number of questions to ask

    ./answer article.txt questions.txt
        article.txt  - the article to answer questions with
        question.txt - the questions to answer

When you have finished with our system, please remmeber to kill the BART server by running (the server is started automatically by the answer script)

    ./kill_server
